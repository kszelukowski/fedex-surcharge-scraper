# FedEx International Fuel Surcharge Scraper  
**Playwright · Python · asyncio**

A small but complete web-scraping project that demonstrates how to reliably extract data from a modern, dynamic website using **Playwright (Python)** and **asyncio**.

The script navigates the FedEx surcharge page, handles cookie consent and geo-location modals, interacts with dynamic UI elements, and extracts structured data from a table.
